      description: "Lawry’s The Prime Rib Singapore was one of the first international Lawry’s locations since this world-famous restaurant first opened in Beverly Hills, LA way back in 1938. Since 2010, the home of Lawry’s The Prime Rib has been inside Mandarin Gallery on Orchard Road, right in the heart of Singapore’s busiest shopping district with four-metre high floor to ceiling windows and so much elegance you can’t help but be impressed. Lawry Singapore’s main attraction is, of course, the USDA prime rib of beef that’s aged for 21 days on a bed of rock salt and then carved at your table from the famous silver cart, but for lunch as well as dinner you’ll find plenty more besides. Reservations are essential at Lawry’s The Prime Rib Singapore, so head to Orchard with one in your pocket.",
